**NOTICE: My RT-N16 HW died after years of good work => I've no test device => this asuswrt-merlin fork not developed anymore !**

# asuswrt-merlin for RT-N16

This is an quick but up-to-date fork of [asuswrt-merlin](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin) specially for RT-N16 routers.

## Status

- Version *380.61-b1* works ok

## Bugs

- Some pages not working/segfaulting (ie. Tools)
- Once you are running this image, only manual upgrade is possible (`mtd-write -i <trx> -d linux`)
- SAMBA and MEDIA SERVER support excluded (if you are using this image, you surely know how to install them via opkg)
